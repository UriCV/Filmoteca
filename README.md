## About the project
This project is part of a formation course by FactoriaF5 where de main goal is to adquire the ability to create a fully functional web page that can acces a fake api and gives the user the possibility to do the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete).

## The page
My Movies is a web page where the user can save watched movies as well as seen te movies list with all the information displayed as wel as deleting the movies. Another feature is the searchbar which the user can use to search a specific movie. The web app is completely responsive and works on phone and tablet.
